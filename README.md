California House Price Prediction

Overview
  This script is designed to predict house prices in California using a machine learning model. It utilizes extensive data treatment techniques to preprocess and clean the data before training the model. The prediction is based on a variety of features including square   footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant factors.

Requirements:
  Python 3.x
  Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn


Installation Process: 
  Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/california-house-price-prediction.git
  Install required libraries:
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  The script will perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generate predictions.

Data Treatment Process:
  Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
  Feature Engineering: Creating new features, transforming variables, and encoding categorical data.
  Normalization/Scaling: Scaling numerical features to a similar range to enhance model performance.
  Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting relevant features for training the model.
  Model Training: Utilizing machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) to predict house prices.

Results:
The script generates model evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to assess prediction accuracy. Additionally, it produces visualizations to aid in understanding the data and model performance.

Notes
  Ensure your dataset contains accurate and relevant information to obtain better predictions.
  Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
